This project is an interactive, magical website with a fantasy theme. It consists of three pages:  

1. **Homepage (`index.html`)** – the exterior of the Tipsy Troll Tavern, providing an introduction to the location.  
2. **Tavern (`tavern.html`)** – the interior of the tavern, featuring flickering lamps, smoke effects, magical details, and interactive elements such as “Today’s Special” and the “About Us” information.  
3. **Backroom (`hiddenHand.html`)** – a mysterious room called “The Hidden Hand”, with living candles, magical particles, and blue glow effects. Users can click on specific areas to open a popup and send messages, which are logged to the console and stored locally.  

The website is built using **HTML, CSS, and JavaScript**, emphasizing visual effects and interactivity to provide an engaging experience.
